"""
Python API to allow creation of streaming applications for
IBM Streams & Streaming Analytics service on Bluemix.

Overview
########

IBMÂ® Streams is an advanced analytic platform that allows user-developed applications to quickly ingest,
analyze and correlate information as it arrives from thousands of real-time sources.
Streams can handle very high data throughput rates, millions of events or messages per second.
With this API Python developers can build streaming applications that can be executed using IBM Streams,
including the processing being distributed across multiple computing resources (hosts or machines) for scalability.
