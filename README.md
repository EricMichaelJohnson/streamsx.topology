# streamsx.topology
A project that supports building streaming topologies (applications)
for IBM Streams in different programming languages, such as Java.


## Java Application API
The Java Application API enables a developer to create streaming applications entirely in Java for IBM Streams. The API employs a functional style of programming -- a developer may define a graph's flow and data manipulation simultaneously.
